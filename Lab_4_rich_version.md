## Task 1

### What is PKI, and what is the purpose of PKI with OpenVPN?

**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** - is a framework of policies, procedures, and technologies that enables secure communication and authentication over a network. It uses cryptographic techniques such as asymmetric encryption, digital certificates, and certificate authorities (CAs) to establish trust between entities.

In OpenVPN, PKI ensures secure communication between clients and servers by:

1. **Authentication** - verifying the identity of the server and clients using digital certificates.
2. **Confidentiality** - encrypting communication so that only intended parties can read the data.
3. **Integrity** - ensuring transmitted data has not been tampered with using digital signatures.
4. **Non-repudiation** - preventing either party from denying their involvement in the communication.

Using PKI in OpenVPN, each client and server has its own certificate and private key, while a trusted CA validates these certificates to establish trust.

### Distinguish between a master certificate authority and a separate certificate authority

1. **Master Certificate Authority** - is the root of trust in the PKI hierarchy. It creates and signs the root certificate, which is used to issue or validate all other certificates. Master CA typically kept offline or in a highly secure environment to protect its private key, as its compromise would invalidate the entire PKI structure.

2. **Separate Certificate Authority (CA)** - is delegated authority from the master CA to issue certificates for clients, servers, or subordinate entities. Its private key is signed by the master CA, making its certificates trusted. It also allows operational flexibility, as the master CA remains offline while the intermediate CA handles day-to-day certificate issuance and management.

### **Additional Context (NB Case):**

- **Private Key** - each client has a unique private key corresponding to their certificate.
- **Public Key** - the public key is part of the clientâ€™s certificate and is used for encryption and verification.
- **Certificate Signing** - The master CA signs both the server and client certificates, ensuring trust in the entire PKI chain. The separate CA, if used, may handle the task of issuing individual client or server certificates, reducing the risk of exposing the master CA's private key.

## Task 2 - Set-Up

### 2.a Install, build, and initialize a Public Key Infrastructure for an installed OpenVPN.

I will follow [oficial](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/how-to-install-and-use-openvpn) documentation to configure VPN.

Let's install openvpn & easy-rsa (Figure 1)

```sh
apt install -y openvpn easy-rsa
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a2ffbb2-281c-4dd5-9504-17b8573fffb2)

First step is to create CA directiory.

```
sudo make-cadir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4da08873-7f6e-4f67-b57d-4f3fd77729a2)

Next step is pki initialization and CA building

```
 ./easyrsa init-pki
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93473e07-4cb2-4327-814a-e6ec7bdfa6b3)

```
./easyrsa build-ca
```

### 2.b  What did you notice about the prompt when creating a CA? What is the reason behind creating and using a passphrase?

The PEM passphrase set when creating the CA will be asked for every time you need to encrypt the output of a command (such as a private key). The encryption here is important, to avoid printing any private key in plain text.

### 2.c Generate Diffie Hellman parameters and key pair for the server. Show the location(path) of the key pair generated.

Let's generate key pair for server

```
./easyrsa gen-req fedorov_alexey_server nopass
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca82a551-40e6-4f9f-a128-c3d5ca07167e)

Now I create Diffie-Hellman parameter for server

```
./easyrsa gen-dh
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aee97ad-181a-4a59-bc46-a02f79259897)

### 2.d What is the size of the Diffie Hellman parameters and their locations?

Size of the Diffie Hellman is 2048 bits

```
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/dh.pem
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c3634c8-f3ff-429b-a883-812777c7e20a)


Documentation recommends to move files to `/etc/openvpn` :

```
cp pki/dh.pem pki/ca.crt pki/issued/myservername.crt pki/private/myservername.key /etc/openvpn/
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2aa7977-a876-4782-b2b4-e45a9491b3a7)

### 2.e Create a certificate for the server. What is the commonName value, and how many days are the certificates signed on the server?

Finally I create certificate for the server

```
./easyrsa sign-req server fedorov_alexey_server
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/011d54b3-4b1c-41e9-a09a-83cfe8b6a350)

Certificate signed for 825 days

**commonName**
```
commonName = fedorov_alexey_server
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/161503b6-a8ad-41be-a073-14c27bb26935)

### 2.f Create a key for the client and also a client certificate. What is the expiration date of the certificate?

Let's create client key pair

```
./easyrsa gen-req fedorov_alexey_client nopass
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03481c2c-a280-4612-b44a-88220dcca464)

And client certificate too

```
./easyrsa sign-req client fedorov_alexey_client
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a02b0e-a921-4e1d-953e-3459d23caf8f)

Certificate expiration date is `Dec 20 20:08:45 2026`

### 3.a What is the TLS Authentication (TA) Key, and why is it essential in OpenVPN?

TSL Authentication key is used for `tls-auth`. The `tls-auth` directive adds an extra **HMAC** signature to all **SSL/TLS** handshake packets to verify their integrity. Any **UDP** packet without the correct **HMAC** signature is discarded. This **HMAC** signature enhances the security provided by **SSL/TLS** and offers protection against:

#### Advantages:

1. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or flooding on the OpenVPN UDP port.
2. Port scans aimed at identifying open server UDP ports.
3. Buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the SSL/TLS implementation.
4. Unauthorized machines attempting to initiate SSL/TLS handshakes.

It is essential for openvpn because it creates additional nessesary security level. 

### 3.b Generate TLS Authentication (server) and show the server key information



### 3.c. Generate a TLS Authentication key (client) and show the client key information
